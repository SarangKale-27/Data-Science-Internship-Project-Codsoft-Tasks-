Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
A Machine Learning project to predict the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

📌 Project Overview
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project involves building a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived or not using the classic Titanic dataset.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Features & Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values in 'Age' (Mean imputation) and 'Embarked' (Mode imputation).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized survival trends based on Pclass, Sex, and Age.

Feature Engineering: - Performed One-Hot Encoding for categorical data.

Identified outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.

Modeling: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier.

Evaluation: Achieved a model accuracy of 78.2%.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

Install dependencies:

Open Titanic.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run all cells.

📉 Results
The model shows that factors like being in a higher passenger class (Pclass 1) and being female significantly increased the chances of survival.
