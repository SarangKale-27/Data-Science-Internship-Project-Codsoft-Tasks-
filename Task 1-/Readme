# CodSoft Data Science Internship - Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the work for Task 1 of my Data Science internship at CodSoft. 

## 📋 Project Description
The goal of this task is to create a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, passenger class, and more. 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tool:** Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked` columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized key features to find correlations with survival rates.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Used One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and checked for outliers in `Age`.
4. **Machine Learning:** Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to perform the classification.
5. **Evaluation:** The model achieved an accuracy of **78.2%**.

## 📊 Summary of Results
The analysis showed that 'Sex' and 'Pclass' were major predictors of survival, reflecting the "women and children first" policy during the disaster.

## Project Overview
This project covers:
- Handling missing values
- Converting categorical features
- Normalizing numerical features
- Outlier detection and treatment

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers including:
- Survival status (Survived)
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Age, Sex, Fare
- Embarkation port (Embarked)
- Cabin information

Original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Cleaning Steps

### 1. Missing Value Treatment
- Age: Filled with median value
- Embarked: Filled with most frequent value (mode)
- Cabin: Dropped (too many missing values)

### 2. Categorical Encoding
- Sex: Label encoded (male=0, female=1)
- Embarked: One-hot encoded

### 3. Feature Scaling
- Age and Fare standardized using StandardScaler

### 4. Outlier Handling
- Fare outliers capped using IQR method
- Visualized with boxplots before/after treatment

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
